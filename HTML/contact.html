<h1 id="fucss">Find Us</h1>
At Marshallâ€™s you can eat and shop at our latest addition, a small farm situated between Edinburgh and Carlisle which onlooks the fresh grassy lowlands, or the original and beautiful location, Aberdeenshire countryside with Bennachie in the background. You can often see our farmer employees hard at work and the produce we grow in our fields is all handpicked and within walking distance from the shop itself.
