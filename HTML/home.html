<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p id="para1">


Welcome To Marshall’s Farm Shop & Kitchen
<br><br>
The farming enterprise started back in the late 1970s so Kenny has had farming in his blood from an early age. Over the years, the farming business grew substantially, to include a 500 suckler and 400 dairy herd.
<br><br>
“Farming and family are at the heart of everything here at Marshall’s. The girls are very much part of all aspects of the business and its development. Having all completed further education after school and had the opportunity to experience other workplace environments, all three daughters are now back home in the family business.
<br><br>
At Marshall’s you can eat and shop at our latest addition a small farm situated between Edinburgh and Carlisle which onlooks the fresh grassy lowlands, or the original and beautiful location, Aberdeenshire countryside with Bennachie in the background. You can often see our farmer employees hard at work and the produce we grow in our fields is all handpicked and within walking distance from the shop itself.
<br><br>
We strive to offer a first-class experience showcasing the value of farming to our local communities. Our passion and drive are to provide top quality homegrown produce and the best service to every customer that steps through the door. From day one our aim has been to teach our communities what is available ‘on their doorstep’ and the importance of supporting local”.
